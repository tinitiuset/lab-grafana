# DevOps and Observability

DevOps is a culture that promotes collaboration between development and operations teams
to deploy code to production faster in an automated and repeatable way. The idea is to
build a culture of shared responsibility for the release of software features and
updates. This culture shift shortens the development cycle, increases deployment
frequency, and helps to deliver more dependable software releases.

Microservices and containers are often used in DevOps environments. Microservices are
small, independent services that work together. Containers are a way to package software
so that it can run consistently across computing environments. Microservices and
containers are often used together because containers are a good way to deploy
microservices.

Distribution of these microservices across multiple containers and hosts makes it
difficult to understand the state of the system. This is where observability comes in.
Observability is the extent to which you can understand the internal state or condition
of a complex system based only on knowledge of its external outputs. The more observable
a system, the more quickly and accurately you can navigate from an identified performance
problem to its root cause, without additional testing or coding.

Observability in its current form is a relatively new concept. It is an evolution of
monitoring, which is the process of collecting and analyzing data about a system. The
goal of monitoring is to ensure that the system is operating as expected. Observability
is a more proactive approach that allows you to understand the state of the system and
identify problems before they occur.
