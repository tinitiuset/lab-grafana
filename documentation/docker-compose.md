# Docker Compose

> Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications.
> With Compose, you use a YAML file to configure your application's services.
> Then, with a single command, you create and start all the services from your configuration.
> [Compose Reference](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
